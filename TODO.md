# PUBG Battle Royale Game - Implementation Progress

## Core Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup & Architecture
- [x] Create sandbox environment with Next.js
- [x] Analyze package.json and dependencies
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [ ] Create Next.js layout and page structure
- [ ] Set up game component architecture

### 2. Game Core Systems
- [ ] Implement game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Create state management (Menu → Playing → GameOver)
- [ ] Set up Canvas 2D rendering system
- [ ] Implement camera system with viewport culling
- [ ] Create input handling (keyboard/mouse/touch)

### 3. Map & World Generation
- [ ] Generate battle royale map (2048x2048)
- [ ] Create procedural terrain (cities, forests, compounds)
- [ ] Implement loot spawn points (200+ locations)
- [ ] Add collision system for buildings/terrain
- [ ] Create minimap with real-time tracking

### 4. Safe Zone System
- [ ] Implement shrinking safe zone mechanics
- [ ] Add zone damage system
- [ ] Create visual zone indicators
- [ ] Add zone timer and warnings
- [ ] Balance zone progression (8 phases, 16 minutes)

### 5. Player Systems
- [ ] Create player entity with health/armor
- [ ] Implement movement (WASD, crouch, prone)
- [ ] Add inventory system (60 slots)
- [ ] Create equipment management
- [ ] Add interaction system (pickup/drop items)

### 6. Weapon & Combat System
- [ ] Implement weapon categories (AR, SMG, Sniper, Pistol)
- [ ] Create damage calculation system
- [ ] Add ballistics (bullet drop, travel time)
- [ ] Implement reload and ammo system
- [ ] Add weapon attachments

### 7. AI Bot System
- [ ] Create AI bot entities (99 bots)
- [ ] Implement basic pathfinding (A*)
- [ ] Add combat AI behavior
- [ ] Create zone awareness logic
- [ ] Balance bot difficulty progression

### 8. User Interface
- [ ] Design and implement HUD
  - [ ] Health/armor bars
  - [ ] Ammo counter
  - [ ] Minimap
  - [ ] Kill feed
  - [ ] Player count
- [ ] Create inventory UI
- [ ] Add settings menu
- [ ] Implement game statistics

### 9. Audio & Visual Effects
- [ ] Implement Web Audio API system
- [ ] Add weapon sounds with distance
- [ ] Create footstep audio system
- [ ] Add visual effects (muzzle flash, tracers)
- [ ] Implement hit markers and blood effects

### 10. Performance & Polish
- [ ] Optimize rendering with object pooling
- [ ] Implement LOD system
- [ ] Add mobile touch controls
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Game balance and testing

### 11. Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

### 12. Build & Testing
- [ ] Build application with pnpm run build --no-lint
- [ ] Start production server
- [ ] Test complete gameplay loop
- [ ] Validate performance (60fps target)
- [ ] Test on different devices/browsers

### 13. Final Deployment
- [ ] Final game testing and validation
- [ ] Performance verification
- [ ] User experience testing
- [ ] Deploy and provide preview URL
